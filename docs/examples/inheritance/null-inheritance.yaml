# Null Inheritance Pattern
# When table column is null, it inherits the reusable column with the SAME NAME

columns:
  id:
    type: integer
    sequence: true
    primary_key: true

  name:
    type: varchar
    size: 100

  email:
    type: varchar
    size: 255

  created_at:
    type: timestamp

tables:
  users:
    columns:
      id: null           # Inherits 'id' column definition as 'id'
      name: null         # Inherits 'name' column definition as 'name'
      email: null        # Inherits 'email' column definition as 'email'
      created_at: null   # Inherits 'created_at' column definition as 'created_at'

  # Result: users table has columns: id, name, email, created_at
  # with exact same types and constraints as defined in reusable columns
