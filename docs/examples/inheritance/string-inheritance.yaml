# String Inheritance Pattern
# When table column is a string, it inherits the named reusable column with a NEW NAME

columns:
  id:
    type: integer
    sequence: true
    primary_key: true

  name:
    type: varchar
    size: 100

  amount:
    type: numeric
    size: 10
    decimal: 2

  timestamp:
    type: timestamp

tables:
  products:
    columns:
      product_id: id        # Inherits 'id' definition as 'product_id'
      product_name: name    # Inherits 'name' definition as 'product_name'
      price: amount         # Inherits 'amount' definition as 'price'
      created_at: timestamp # Inherits 'timestamp' definition as 'created_at'

  orders:
    columns:
      order_id: id          # Inherits 'id' definition as 'order_id'
      customer_name: name   # Inherits 'name' definition as 'customer_name'
      total: amount         # Inherits 'amount' definition as 'total'
      order_date: timestamp # Inherits 'timestamp' definition as 'order_date'

  # Result:
  # products: product_id, product_name, price, created_at
  # orders: order_id, customer_name, total, order_date
  # All with appropriate types from the reusable columns
